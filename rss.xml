		<description><![CDATA[Redvolume presents Catalogue Part One CD compilation! Collected on the disc, is the label's full output so far, together with some previously unreleased tunes from up and coming producers. This compilation might just be the most diverse collection of dubstep to date, capturing everything from industrial influences to ragga and vocals.

Opening track, "Mass Dampers" by Ekstrak, is upcoming on DJ/Rupture's mix-CD "Uproot". Nordic bass heroes L-Wiz and Tes La Rok show that it's not just a UK thing, side by side with Bristol producer, Forsaken, representing the UK scene outside of London. As for the vocals, Redvolume is proud to present Hit By A Rock's gorgeous remix of Mercury Prize nominee Susheela Raman's "Love Lies", hoping to take you on an inspiring journey into what we love and call dubstep.
